Description: The package is able to perform an automatic or interactive quality control on
          .fcs data acquired using flow cytometry instruments. By evaluating three different
          properties: 1) flow rate, 2) signal acquisition, 3) dynamic range, the quality
          control enables the detection and removal of anomalies.
